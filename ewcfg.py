Being a huge, highly flammable balloon filled with hydrogen, it is the safest way to travel in the city only because it's out of the price range of most juveniles' budget. It's used by the rich elite to travel from their summer homes in Assault Flats Beach to their winter homes in Dreadford, and vice versa, without having to step foot in the more unsavory parts of the city. It does it's job well and only occasionally bursts into flames."
str_blimp_tower_description = "This mooring mast is mostly used for amassing millionaire mooks into the marvelous Neo Milwaukee multi-story zeppelin, m'lady. Basically, you can board a blimp here. All you have to do is walk up an extremely narrow spiral staircase without an adequate handrail for about 40 feet straight up and then you can embark onto the highest airship this side of the River of Slime! It'll be great! Don't mind the spontaneously combusting zeppelins crashing into the earth in the distance. That's normal."
str_downtown_station_description = "This large, imposing structure is the central hub for the entire city's rapid transit system. A public transportation powerhouse, it contains connections to every subway line in the city, and for dirt cheap. Inside of it's main terminal, a humongous split-flap display is constantly updating with the times of subway arrivals and departures.

It provides just enough for its commuting salarymen to get to work in the morning and home at night."
str_red_subway_station_description = "This sparsely decorated terminal replicates the feeling of riding on a Red Line train, otherwise known as inducing suicidal thoughts. Dim lighting barely illuminates the moldy, stained terminal walls. Inbound and outbound trains arrive and departure one after another with unreal temporal precision. You're not sure if you've ever seen a Red Line train be late. Still doesn't make you like being on one though."
str_green_subway_description = "Easily the oldest subway line in the city, with the interior design and general cleanliness to prove it. Once cutting edge, it's art deco stylings have begun to deteriorate due to overuse and underfunding.

It's vintage aesthetic only exasperating it's crumbling infrastructure, making the whole line seem like a old, dilapidated mess. But, you'll give it one thing, it's pretty cool looking from the perspective of urban exploration. You've dreamed of exploring it's vast, abandoned subway networks ever since you first rode on it. They could lead to anywhere. So close, and yet so mysterious."
str_blue_subway_description = "Probably the nicest subway line in the city, the Blue Line isn't defined by its poor hygiene or mechanical condition. Instead, it's defined by its relative normality. More-or-less clean floors, brightly lit interiors, upholstery on the seats. These stunning, almost sci-fi levels of perfection are a sight to behold. Wow!"

With limited amounts of graffiti sprayed unto the otherwise sort-of white walls, there's actually some semblance of visual simplicity. For once in this city, your eyes aren't being completely assaulted with information or blinding lights. Boring, this place sucks. Board whatever train you're getting on and get back to killing people as soon as possible."
str_yellow_subway_description = "If there's one word to describe the Yellow Line, it's \"confusing\". It's by far the filthiest subway line in the city, which is exponentially worsened by it's bizarre, unexplainable faux wood paneling that lines every train. You can only imagine that this design decision was made to make the subway feel less sterile and more homely, but the constant stench of piss and homeless people puking sort of ruins that idea. Riding the Yellow Line makes you feel like you're at your grandma's house every single time you ride it, if your grandma's house was in Jaywalker Plain."
str_yellow_subway_station_description = "It's absolutely fucking disgusting. By far the worst subway line, the Yellow Line can't keep it's terrible interior design choices contained to its actual trains. Even in its terminals, the faux wood paneling clashes with every other aesthetic element present. It's ghastly ceilings have turned a delightful piss-soaked shade of faded white. It's bizarre mixture of homely decorations and completely dilapidated state makes you oddly beguiled in a way. How did they fuck up the Yellow Line so bad? The world may never know."

With settlements in the area predating the emergence of slime, its prime location along the newly formed coastline naturally grew it into the cultural, economic, and literal center of the city. Due to its symbolic and strategic importance, it's home to the most intense gang violence of the city. Gunshots and screams followed by police sirens are background noises for this district. Some say that this propensity for violence is result of the sinister influence from an old obelisk in the center of town, ominously called ENDLESS WAR. You aren’t sure if you believe that, though.\n\nThis area contains ENDLESS WAR, SlimeCorp HQ, the Slime Stock Exchange and the Downtown Subway Station. To the north is Smogsburg.
